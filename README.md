TYPO3_Skeleton
==============

This skeleton should be installed by our TYPO3 Installscript. Get it here: https://gist.github.com/h3nn3s/b773d97cfc8c8a670b8a

Base skeleton for new TYPO3 projects featuring a directory structure and some base TypoScript files relevant for most of our projects

To pull the current repository contents to the destination on webserver simply execute the following via ssh:
`git pull git@github.com:teamdigitalde/TYPO3_Skeleton.git`

Add the following uncommented line, to the website's root page Resources > TypoScript Configuration to include this file
`<INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE:fileadmin/templates/example.com/TsConfig/page.ts">`

Add the following uncommented line, to the root sys_template Constants to include this file
`<INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE:fileadmin/templates/example.com/TypoScript/Constants/Constants.ts">`

Add the following uncommented line, to the root sys_template Setup to include this file
`<INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="DIR:fileadmin/templates/example.com/TypoScript" extensions="ts" >`

After fetching the default files, the only thing to to is adding a new root template to the root page, adding static extension templates and overwriting some constants. Done :-)
